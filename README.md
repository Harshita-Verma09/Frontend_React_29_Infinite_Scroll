## React Query

React Query is used for efficient data fetching and caching. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It allows for rapid UI development by providing pre-built utility classes.

## Future Improvements
